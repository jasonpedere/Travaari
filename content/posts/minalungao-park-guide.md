If you're looking for a breathtaking adventure in the heart of Central Luzon, Minalungao National Park in General Tinio, Nueva Ecija, should be at the top of your list. Known for its stunning emerald-green river cutting through towering limestone cliffs, it's a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.

Here’s a complete guide to help you plan your first visit.

### What to See and Do

Minalungao is an adventurer's playground. The main attraction is the Peñaranda River, and most activities revolve around it.

* **Bamboo Rafting:** This is the quintessential Minalungao experience. Rent a bamboo raft (`balsa`) to cruise along the serene river. You can bring your own food and have a picnic right on the raft.
* **Cliff Diving:** For the adrenaline junkies, there are designated spots where you can safely jump from the limestone cliffs into the refreshing river below.
* **Ziplining:** Get a bird's-eye view of the park by riding the zipline that crosses the river.
