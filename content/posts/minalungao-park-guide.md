What to See and Do
Minalungao is an adventurer's playground. The main attraction is the Peñaranda River, and most activities revolve around it.

Bamboo Rafting: This is the quintessential Minalungao experience. Rent a bamboo raft (balsa) to cruise along the serene river. You can bring your own food and have a picnic right on the raft while you float between the magnificent rock formations. It's the best way to soak in the incredible scenery.

Spelunking (Caving): There are several small caves to explore. It's a short and relatively easy trek, but it's best to hire a local guide to lead you through the dark passages and share stories about the place.

Cliff Diving: For the adrenaline junkies, there are designated spots where you can safely jump from the limestone cliffs into the refreshing river below. Always check with your guide for the safest spots to jump.

Ziplining: Get a bird's-eye view of the park by riding the zipline that crosses the river. It's a thrilling ride that offers a unique perspective of the landscape.

Hike to the Cross: For a panoramic view of the entire park, take the 1,000-step climb to the giant cross perched atop one of the highest hills. It's a bit of a workout, but the stunning 360-degree view is absolutely worth it.

How to Get There
From Manila/Cabanatuan:
The easiest way to get to Minalungao is by private vehicle. If you're commuting:

From Manila (terminals in Cubao or Pasay), take a bus bound for Cabanatuan City. The trip takes about 3-4 hours.

From the Cabanatuan Central Terminal, your best option is to hire a tricycle for a special trip directly to Minalungao National Park. It's a long ride (about 1-2 hours), so be sure to negotiate the price beforehand. It's best to arrange for the same driver to pick you up at a set time for your return journey.

Final Tips for First-Timers
Visit on a weekday to avoid the large crowds. The park can get very busy on weekends and holidays.

Bring your own food and water, as options inside the park are limited and can be pricey.

Pack light, but don't forget the essentials: sunscreen, a hat, swimwear, and a dry bag for your electronics.

Wear comfortable footwear like sandals with straps or aqua shoes, as you'll be walking on uneven terrain and getting in and out of the water.

Hire a local guide. They can enhance your experience, ensure your safety, and it's a great way to support the local community.
